    <p>
        The <tt>keys.openpgp.org</tt> server is a public service for the
        distribution and discovery of OpenPGP-compatible keys, commonly
        referred to as a "keyserver".
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>For instructions, see our <a href="/about/usage">usage guide</a>.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>How it works</h3>

    <p>
        An OpenPGP key contains two types of information:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical data</strong> is all the technical information
            about the key itself. This includes the large numbers used for
            verifying signatures and encrypting messages.
            It also includes metadata like date of creation, some
            expiration dates, and revocation status.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Identity information</strong> includes the parts of
            a key that identify its owner (known as "User IDs"), in
            particular e-mail addresses.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Traditionally, these pieces of information have always been distributed
        together. On <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span>, they are
        treated differently.  While anyone can upload all parts of any OpenPGP key
        to <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span>, our keyserver
        will only retain and publish certain parts under certain
        conditions:
    </p>

    <p>
        Any valid <strong>technical data</strong> will be stored and freely redistributed.
        Anyone can download these parts at any time as they contain only
        technical information which can't be used to directly identify a person.
        Good OpenPGP software can use <span class="brand">keys.openpgp.org</span>
        to keep this information up to date for any key that it knows about.
        This helps OpenPGP users maintain secure and reliable communication.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>identity information</strong> in an OpenPGP key
        is only distributed with consent.
        It contains personal data, and is not strictly necessary for
        a key to be used for encryption or signature verification. Once the
        owner gives consent by verifying their e-mail address, the key can
        be found by everyone via search by address.
    </p>

    <h3>Community and platform</h3>

    <p>
        This service is run as a community effort. You can talk to us in
        ##hagrid on Freenode IRC, also reachable as #hagrid:stratum0.org on
        Matrix. The folks who are running this come from various projects in the
        OpenPGP ecosystem including Sequoia-PGP, OpenKeychain, and Enigmail.
    </p>

    <p>
        Technically, <tt>keys.openpgp.org</tt> runs on the
        <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/hagrid" target="_blank">Hagrid</a>
        keyserver software, which is based on
        <a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org">Sequoia-PGP</a>.  We are hosted on the
        <a href="https://eclips.is" target="_blank">eclips.is</a> platform,
        a hosting provider focused on Internet Freedom projects, run by
        <a href="https://greenhost.net/" target="_blank">Greenhost</a>.
